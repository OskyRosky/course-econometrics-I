# Econometrics I

Interpretation and Analysis of Economic Statistics

1. Course Overview

This repository contains the academic material for Econometrics I, formally titled Interpretation and Analysis of Economic Statistics, a foundational course in applied statistics for economics and business analysis.

The course introduces students to statistical concepts and techniques with a strong emphasis on economic data, quantitative reasoning, and data-driven decision-making. It serves as a critical bridge between basic statistics and more advanced analytical courses such as econometrics, time series analysis, and economic forecasting.

2. Course Objectives

The main objective of this course is to develop students’ ability to analyze, interpret, and communicate economic information using statistical methods.

Specifically, the course aims to:

	•	Build a solid foundation in descriptive and inferential statistics applied to economics.
	•	Develop quantitative reasoning for economic problem-solving.
	•	Introduce probability theory and its role in economic analysis.
	•	Apply statistical inference techniques such as estimation and hypothesis testing.
	•	Strengthen data analysis skills using computational tools.
	•	Prepare students for advanced econometric and analytical coursework.

3. Statistical Foundations for Economic Analysis

The course begins with the core concepts of statistics applied to economics:

	•	Definition and scope of statistics.
	•	Historical development of statistics.
	•	Areas of application in economics and business.
	•	Types of statistical data and variables (quantitative and qualitative).
	•	Units of measurement and data collection techniques.
	•	Population, samples, and sampling methods.
	•	Observational studies and experimental designs.
	•	Data quality and reliability.

This foundation ensures students understand how economic data is generated, structured, and analyzed.

4. Descriptive Statistics and Data Visualization

A major component of the course focuses on summarizing and presenting economic information:

	•	Absolute and relative numbers.
	•	Ratios, proportions, and percentages.
	•	Frequency distributions.
	•	Indicators and economic indexes.
	•	Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode).
	•	Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation).
	•	Symmetry and skewness of distributions.
	•	Textual, tabular, and graphical data representation.
	•	Advanced visualization techniques:
	•	Charts and graphs
	•	Maps
	•	Dashboards and storytelling with data

These tools allow students to transform raw economic data into meaningful insights.

5. Probability and Statistical Inference

The course introduces probability as the backbone of statistical inference:

	•	Basic probability concepts and definitions.
	•	Events and sample spaces.
	•	Discrete and continuous probability distributions.
	•	The normal distribution and standard normal curve.
	•	Standardization and real-world applications.
	•	Introduction to statistical inference:
	•	Point estimation
	•	Interval estimation
	•	Hypothesis testing
	•	Application of inference methods in economic contexts.

Students learn how uncertainty is quantified and managed in economic analysis.

6. Applied Analysis Using Excel

A key practical component of the course is the use of Microsoft Excel as an analytical tool:

	•	Calculation of descriptive statistics.
	•	Analysis of position and variability.
	•	Creation of pivot tables for economic data.
	•	Visualization using charts, maps, and dashboards.
	•	Decision-making supported by quantitative evidence.
	•	Data-driven storytelling for economic reports.

Excel is used as a bridge between theory and professional practice in economics and business environments.

7. Teaching Methodology and Evaluation

The course follows a flipped classroom methodology, emphasizing active learning:

	•	Conceptual material is studied independently.
	•	Class sessions focus on application, analysis, and discussion.
	•	Group-based case studies analyzing real economic situations.
	•	Continuous feedback and collaborative learning.

Evaluation includes:

	•	Economic case study analyses.
	•	Excel-based visualization projects.
	•	Class participation.
	•	A final applied research project combining statistical analysis and economic interpretation.
